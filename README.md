Description:

Difficulty Levels: The game provides four difficulty levels—Easy, Normal, Hard, and Expert—ensuring a suitable challenge for players of varying skill levels.

Guaranteed Generation: Sudoku puzzles are dynamically generated using the backtracking algorithm, ensuring both complexity and a valid solution for every puzzle.

Real-Time Validation: Players can verify the correctness of their solution at any point, thanks to a real-time validation button.

On-Screen Numeric Keypad: Enhancing user experience, the game incorporates an on-screen numeric keypad, enabling seamless number input without relying on an external physical keyboard.

Pencil Marks: To aid in strategic planning, players can use pencil marks, a feature that allows the temporary notation of possible numbers, facilitating a more methodical approach to solving puzzles.
